Heart Disease Classification Project
Overview
This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques for the supervised classification of heart disease. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify whether a person has heart disease based on a set of input features. The dataset used for this project contains relevant health metrics and patient information.

Technologies Used
Scikit-learn: The project heavily relies on the scikit-learn library for implementing machine learning algorithms, model evaluation, and preprocessing tasks.

Pandas: Pandas is used for data manipulation and analysis. It helps in loading, cleaning, and organizing the dataset efficiently.

NumPy: NumPy is utilized for numerical operations and handling arrays, providing a foundation for various mathematical operations in the project.

Matplotlib: Matplotlib is employed for creating informative visualizations that aid in understanding the data distribution, feature importance, and model performance.

Project Structure
The project is structured into different phases:

Data Preprocessing: In this phase, the dataset is loaded using Pandas, missing values are handled, and features are preprocessed for model training.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Matplotlib is employed to create visualizations that help in understanding the distribution of data, relationships between features, and potential patterns.

Model Development: Scikit-learn's machine learning algorithms are utilized for building and training the classification model. Different algorithms are experimented with to find the one that performs best for the given problem.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the models is evaluated using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. Matplotlib is used to visualize the results.

Deployment: Once a satisfactory model is achieved, it can be deployed for making predictions on new data.
